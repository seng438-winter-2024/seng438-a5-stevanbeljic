# Introduction

# 

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

## Result of model comparison (selecting top two models)
Based on the output of CS-Frat, the two top models seem to be "S" and "NB2". This is because they follow the curve of the data the best. To make a quantitative decision, we took a look at their log-likelihood values, which were the highest, meaning that they provided the best fit of data.

## Result of range analysis (an explanation of which part of data is good for proceeding with the analysis)

## Plots for failure rate and reliability of the SUT for the test data provided
